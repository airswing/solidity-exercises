# Hello, World!

Hello! This is an introductory task that will help you to familiarize with the structure of the smart contract written in solidity.

```
pragma solidity 0.4.23;
```

You might come across version specifier eg. `^0.4.23` but it's the best practice to indicate the compiler version intended by the original author.
